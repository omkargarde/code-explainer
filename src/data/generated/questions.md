[{"id":1,"topic":"JavaScript","difficulty":"Beginner","question":"Explain the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var` in JavaScript. Give an example where using `const` would be beneficial.","expected_answer_outline":"Discuss scope (block vs. function), mutability (reassignment), and hoisting differences.  Example: Using `const` for configuration variables or API keys to prevent accidental modification."},{"id":2,"topic":"JavaScript","difficulty":"Beginner","question":"What is a closure in JavaScript? Provide a simple code example demonstrating a closure.","expected_answer_outline":"A closure is when a function remembers and has access to its lexical scope, even when the function is executed outside that lexical scope. Example should show a function returning another function that accesses a variable from the outer function's scope."},{"id":3,"topic":"JavaScript","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"Explain the concept of Promises in JavaScript. How do they help in handling asynchronous operations? What are the possible states of a Promise?","expected_answer_outline":"Promises represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. They improve code readability compared to callbacks. States: pending, fulfilled, rejected."},{"id":4,"topic":"JavaScript","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"How does `async/await` simplify working with asynchronous code? Show an example of using `async/await` to fetch data from an API.","expected_answer_outline":"`async/await` makes asynchronous code look and behave a bit more like synchronous code, making it easier to read and understand.  Example should include `async` keyword, `await` keyword, and error handling using `try/catch`."},{"id":5,"topic":"JavaScript","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"Describe how you would manipulate the DOM using JavaScript to add a new paragraph element with the text 'Hello, World!' to a div with the ID 'container'.","expected_answer_outline":"Use `document.getElementById('container')` to get the div. Then, use `document.createElement('p')` to create a new paragraph. Set the `textContent` of the paragraph to 'Hello, World!'. Finally, use `appendChild()` to add the paragraph to the div."},{"id":6,"topic":"JavaScript","difficulty":"Advanced","question":"Explain the concept of event delegation in JavaScript. Why is it useful, and how can you implement it?","expected_answer_outline":"Event delegation involves attaching a single event listener to a parent element to handle events triggered by its children. This is more efficient than attaching individual listeners to each child. Implementation involves checking `event.target` to identify the specific child element that triggered the event."},{"id":7,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Beginner","question":"What are React Hooks? Name a few common React Hooks and explain their purpose.","expected_answer_outline":"Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. Examples: `useState` for state management, `useEffect` for side effects, `useContext` for accessing context."},{"id":8,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Beginner","question":"What is the purpose of `useState` in React? Provide a simple example of how to use it.","expected_answer_outline":"`useState` is a Hook that allows you to add state to functional components.  Example should show importing `useState`, declaring a state variable and its update function, and updating the state based on an event."},{"id":9,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"Explain the purpose of `useEffect` in React. How is it different from the lifecycle methods in class components? Provide an example of fetching data using `useEffect`.","expected_answer_outline":"`useEffect` performs side effects in functional components. It's a combination of `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.  Example should show fetching data and setting the state with the fetched data.  Should also discuss the dependency array and its impact on the effect's execution."},{"id":10,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"What is React Context API? Explain a scenario where using Context API would be a good choice.  How do you provide and consume values using Context?","expected_answer_outline":"Context API provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. Good for themes, user authentication, or global configuration.  Explanation should include `createContext`, `Provider`, and `useContext`."},{"id":11,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"Explain the concept of component lifecycle methods in React class components. Describe the purpose of `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.","expected_answer_outline":"`componentDidMount`: Called after the component is mounted (inserted into the DOM). Good for initial data fetching. `componentDidUpdate`: Called after an update occurs.  Useful for responding to prop or state changes. `componentWillUnmount`: Called immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed. Used for cleaning up resources like timers or subscriptions."},{"id":12,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Advanced","question":"Describe different approaches to state management in React. What are the pros and cons of using Context API vs. Redux vs. a library like Zustand?","expected_answer_outline":"Discuss Context API (simple, good for smaller apps), Redux (more complex, good for large apps with complex state), and Zustand (simpler than Redux, good for manageable complexity).  Pros and cons should cover learning curve, boilerplate code, performance, and scalability."},{"id":13,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Advanced","question":"How can you optimize the performance of a React application? Describe techniques like memoization, code splitting, and lazy loading.","expected_answer_outline":"Memoization (using `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders). Code splitting (splitting the application into smaller chunks to reduce initial load time). Lazy loading (loading components or resources only when they are needed).  Other optimizations include: virtualization, optimizing images, and avoiding unnecessary re-renders."},{"id":14,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"What are controlled and uncontrolled components in React? What are the advantages of using controlled components?","expected_answer_outline":"Controlled components: form data is handled by the React component’s state. Uncontrolled components: form data is handled by the DOM itself. Advantages of controlled components: easier to validate data, provide immediate feedback, and programmatically manipulate the form."},{"id":15,"topic":"JavaScript","difficulty":"Advanced","question":"Explain the concept of prototypal inheritance in JavaScript. How does it differ from classical inheritance?","expected_answer_outline":"Prototypal inheritance: objects inherit properties and methods from other objects via the prototype chain. Classical inheritance: uses classes and inheritance hierarchies. Key differences lie in the mechanism of inheritance (prototypes vs. classes) and the flexibility offered."},{"id":16,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Advanced","question":"What is server-side rendering (SSR) in React? What are the benefits of using SSR, and how does it work?","expected_answer_outline":"SSR involves rendering React components on the server and sending the fully rendered HTML to the client. Benefits: improved SEO, faster initial load time. Process: server receives request, renders React components to HTML, sends HTML to the client, client hydrates the HTML with JavaScript."},{"id":17,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"Explain the use of React Fragments. Why and when would you use them?","expected_answer_outline":"React Fragments allow you to group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM. You use them when you need to return multiple elements from a component but don't want to introduce an extra DOM node (like a div).  Mention the shorthand `<> </>` syntax."},{"id":18,"topic":"JavaScript","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"Describe the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript. Explain when you would use each operator.","expected_answer_outline":"`==` performs type coercion before comparison, while `===` does not. Use `===` for strict equality checks to avoid unexpected behavior due to type coercion. `==` can be used when you explicitly want type coercion to occur."},{"id":19,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Beginner","question":"What are props in React? How do you pass data from a parent component to a child component using props?","expected_answer_outline":"Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.  They are read-only from the perspective of the child component.  Example should demonstrate passing a prop as an attribute in the child component's JSX tag."},{"id":20,"topic":"JavaScript","difficulty":"Advanced","question":"Explain the concept of currying in JavaScript. Provide an example of a curried function.","expected_answer_outline":"Currying is a technique where a function with multiple arguments is transformed into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument.  Example should show a function that takes one argument and returns another function that takes the next argument, and so on, until all arguments are provided and the final result is returned."}]
