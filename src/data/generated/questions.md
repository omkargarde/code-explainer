[{"id":1,"topic":"JavaScript","difficulty":"Beginner","question":"Explain the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var` in JavaScript.","expected_answer_outline":"Discuss scope (function vs. block), mutability (re-assignment allowed or not), and hoisting (how the variable declaration is treated before the code is executed) differences. Explain temporal dead zone for `let` and `const`."},{"id":2,"topic":"JavaScript","difficulty":"Beginner","question":"What is a closure in JavaScript? Provide a simple code example.","expected_answer_outline":"Explain that a closure is a function that has access to its outer function's scope even after the outer function has returned. Example: a function that returns another function which uses a variable from the outer function's scope."},{"id":3,"topic":"JavaScript","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"Describe the purpose of Promises in JavaScript. How do you handle asynchronous operations using Promises?","expected_answer_outline":"Explain that Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations and improve code readability and maintainability by avoiding callback hell. Discuss the `then`, `catch`, and `finally` methods. Provide an example of fetching data using `fetch` and handling the response with Promises."},{"id":4,"topic":"JavaScript","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"Explain `async/await` in JavaScript. How does it simplify asynchronous programming?","expected_answer_outline":"Explain that `async/await` is syntactic sugar over Promises that makes asynchronous code look and behave a bit more like synchronous code. Explain that `async` makes a function return a Promise, and `await` waits for a Promise to resolve. Provide an example converting a Promise-based function to use `async/await`."},{"id":5,"topic":"JavaScript","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"How can you manipulate the DOM using JavaScript? Give examples of adding, removing, and modifying elements.","expected_answer_outline":"Discuss methods like `document.getElementById`, `document.querySelector`, `createElement`, `appendChild`, `removeChild`, `setAttribute`, and `textContent`. Provide code examples for each operation (adding a new paragraph, removing an existing element, changing the text content of an element)."},{"id":6,"topic":"JavaScript","difficulty":"Advanced","question":"Explain the concept of prototypal inheritance in JavaScript. How does it differ from classical inheritance?","expected_answer_outline":"Explain that prototypal inheritance is a mechanism in JavaScript where objects inherit properties and methods from other objects through the prototype chain. Contrast this with classical inheritance where classes inherit from other classes. Discuss the use of `__proto__` (though discourage direct use) and `Object.create` to demonstrate inheritance."},{"id":7,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Beginner","question":"What are React Hooks? Why are they useful?","expected_answer_outline":"Explain that React Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. They are useful because they allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. Explain benefits like code reusability, cleaner code, and easier testing."},{"id":8,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Beginner","question":"Explain the difference between `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.","expected_answer_outline":"`useState` is used for managing state within a component. `useEffect` is used for performing side effects like data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM. Explain dependency array in `useEffect`."},{"id":9,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"Describe the React component lifecycle. What are the different lifecycle methods (or hooks) and when are they called?","expected_answer_outline":"Discuss the different phases: mounting, updating, and unmounting. For class components, mention `constructor`, `render`, `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`. For functional components, focus on how `useEffect` covers mounting, updating, and unmounting."},{"id":10,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"What are the different ways to manage state in a React application? Discuss local state, Context API, and Redux (or other state management libraries).","expected_answer_outline":"Explain local state (using `useState`) for component-specific data. Context API for sharing data between components without prop drilling. Redux (or similar) for managing global application state in a predictable way. Mention the trade-offs of each approach in terms of complexity and performance."},{"id":11,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"Explain the purpose of the React Context API. How does it help with prop drilling?","expected_answer_outline":"Explain that the Context API provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It helps avoid prop drilling by allowing components to access data directly from the context provider."},{"id":12,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Advanced","question":"How can you optimize the performance of a React application? Discuss techniques like memoization, code splitting, and lazy loading.","expected_answer_outline":"Discuss `React.memo` for memoizing functional components, `useMemo` and `useCallback` for memoizing values and functions, code splitting using dynamic imports (`import()`), lazy loading components using `React.lazy`, virtualization for rendering large lists, and profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks. Also, mention the importance of using production build."},{"id":13,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Advanced","question":"What is Server-Side Rendering (SSR) in React? What are the advantages and disadvantages of using SSR?","expected_answer_outline":"Explain that SSR is the process of rendering React components on the server and sending the pre-rendered HTML to the client. Advantages: improved SEO, faster initial load time. Disadvantages: increased server complexity, potential performance overhead on the server."},{"id":14,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"Explain the concept of Virtual DOM in React. How does it improve performance?","expected_answer_outline":"Explain that Virtual DOM is a lightweight in-memory representation of the actual DOM. React uses it to track changes and efficiently update only the necessary parts of the real DOM, minimizing expensive DOM manipulations. Discuss reconciliation algorithm."},{"id":15,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Beginner","question":"What are React Fragments and why are they used?","expected_answer_outline":"Explain that Fragments allow you to group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM. They are used to avoid unnecessary wrapper elements when returning multiple elements from a component."},{"id":16,"topic":"JavaScript","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"Explain the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript.","expected_answer_outline":"`==` performs type coercion before comparing values, while `===` performs strict equality comparison without type coercion. Provide examples to illustrate the difference (e.g., `1 == '1'` vs. `1 === '1'`)."},{"id":17,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"What are controlled and uncontrolled components in React? What are their differences and when might you use one over the other?","expected_answer_outline":"Explain that a controlled component's value is controlled by React state, while an uncontrolled component's value is controlled by the DOM itself. Controlled components offer more control and validation, while uncontrolled components can be simpler for basic forms. Discuss the use of `ref` in uncontrolled components."},{"id":18,"topic":"JavaScript","difficulty":"Advanced","question":"Explain the concept of event bubbling and event capturing in the DOM. How can you prevent event propagation?","expected_answer_outline":"Explain event bubbling (event propagates up the DOM tree) and event capturing (event propagates down the DOM tree). Explain how to prevent event propagation using `event.stopPropagation()` and `event.preventDefault()`."}]
