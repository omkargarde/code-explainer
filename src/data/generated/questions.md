[{"id":1,"topic":"JavaScript","difficulty":"Beginner","question":"Explain the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var` in JavaScript. Provide an example for each.","expected_answer_outline":"Discuss scope (block vs. function), mutability (reassignment allowed or not), and hoisting differences. Example code showing each keyword in action."},{"id":2,"topic":"JavaScript","difficulty":"Beginner","question":"What is a closure in JavaScript? Provide a simple code example demonstrating its usage.","expected_answer_outline":"Explain that a closure is a function that has access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed. Example code should clearly show a function returning another function that uses variables from the outer function's scope."},{"id":3,"topic":"JavaScript","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"Explain the purpose of Promises in JavaScript. How do they help with asynchronous operations?  Give a practical example using `fetch` to retrieve data from a URL.","expected_answer_outline":"Explain that Promises provide a way to handle asynchronous operations in a more manageable way than callbacks. Discuss the states of a Promise (pending, fulfilled, rejected). Example code should use `fetch`, `.then()`, and `.catch()` to handle successful and failed responses."},{"id":4,"topic":"JavaScript","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"What are `async` and `await` keywords in JavaScript? How do they relate to Promises? Rewrite the `fetch` example from the previous question using `async/await`.","expected_answer_outline":"Explain that `async` and `await` are syntactic sugar over Promises, making asynchronous code look and behave a bit more like synchronous code. `async` functions always return a Promise. `await` pauses the execution of the function until the Promise is resolved.  Rewrite the `fetch` example to use `async/await` for cleaner code."},{"id":5,"topic":"JavaScript","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"Describe the process of DOM manipulation using JavaScript. How can you select an element, change its text content, and add a new class to it?","expected_answer_outline":"Explain how to use methods like `document.getElementById`, `document.querySelector`, and `document.querySelectorAll` to select elements. Then, discuss how to modify the `textContent` or `innerHTML` property, and how to use `classList.add` to add a class.  Provide code snippets for each operation."},{"id":6,"topic":"JavaScript","difficulty":"Advanced","question":"Explain the concept of event bubbling and event capturing in the DOM. How can you prevent event propagation?","expected_answer_outline":"Explain the phases of event propagation: capturing, target, and bubbling.  Explain how `event.stopPropagation()` can be used to prevent the event from bubbling up to parent elements. Provide a scenario where understanding event bubbling/capturing is crucial."},{"id":7,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Beginner","question":"What are React Hooks? Explain the purpose of `useState` and `useEffect` hooks with simple examples.","expected_answer_outline":"Explain that Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. `useState` allows functional components to have state, and `useEffect` allows you to perform side effects in functional components. Provide simple code examples demonstrating their basic usage."},{"id":8,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"Describe the React component lifecycle. Explain the purpose of `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` (or their modern alternatives with Hooks).","expected_answer_outline":"Explain the different phases: Mounting, Updating, Unmounting. Discuss what each lifecycle method is used for and when it is called. Describe how `useEffect` with different dependency arrays can replicate the behavior of these class-based lifecycle methods."},{"id":9,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"What is state management in React? What are some common approaches for managing state in a React application, and when would you choose one over another?","expected_answer_outline":"Explain that state management is about handling data changes and sharing data across components. Discuss options like: `useState` (for simple local state), Context API (for application-wide data), Redux/Recoil/Zustand (for complex state management). Discuss the trade-offs of each approach and scenarios where each is appropriate."},{"id":10,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"Explain the purpose of the Context API in React. Provide a simple example demonstrating how to create and use a Context.","expected_answer_outline":"Explain that Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. Example code should show creating a Context with `createContext`, providing a value with `<Context.Provider>`, and consuming the value with `useContext`."},{"id":11,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Advanced","question":"Discuss performance optimization techniques in React. Explain how you can prevent unnecessary re-renders of components.  Mention `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback`.","expected_answer_outline":"Discuss strategies like: avoiding unnecessary state updates, using `React.memo` to memoize functional components, using `useMemo` to memoize expensive calculations, using `useCallback` to memoize functions passed as props to prevent re-renders of child components. Also, mention using keys effectively when rendering lists."},{"id":12,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Advanced","question":"What are React Fragments, and why are they useful? Provide an example.","expected_answer_outline":"Explain that Fragments allow you to group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM. This is useful for avoiding unnecessary elements in the HTML structure and can sometimes improve performance. Example showing `<></>` or `<React.Fragment>` being used to wrap multiple elements."},{"id":13,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Beginner","question":"What is JSX? How does it differ from HTML? Give a brief example.","expected_answer_outline":"Explain that JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in React components. It differs from HTML in that it's compiled into JavaScript function calls. Example showing a simple JSX element like `<h1>Hello, world!</h1>` and explaining that it's transformed into `React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, world!')`."},{"id":14,"topic":"JavaScript","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"Explain the concept of prototypal inheritance in JavaScript. How does it differ from classical inheritance?","expected_answer_outline":"Explain that prototypal inheritance is a mechanism where objects inherit properties and methods from other objects through their prototype. In classical inheritance, classes inherit from other classes. JavaScript uses a prototypal model, where objects inherit directly from other objects. Provide an example demonstrating how to create objects and inherit properties using prototypes."},{"id":15,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Advanced","question":"Describe the concept of code splitting in React. How can it improve the performance of a React application?","expected_answer_outline":"Explain that code splitting is a technique to split the application's code into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand. This reduces the initial load time and improves the user experience. Discuss using `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for component-based code splitting, and webpack's dynamic imports."},{"id":16,"topic":"JavaScript","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"What are the different ways to clone an object in JavaScript? What are the differences between shallow copy and deep copy?","expected_answer_outline":"Discuss methods like `Object.assign()`, spread syntax (`...`), and `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(object))` for cloning objects. Explain that shallow copy creates a new object that shares the same references as the original object, while deep copy creates a completely independent copy of the object and its nested objects. Explain the limitations of each method."},{"id":17,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"Explain the concept of controlled and uncontrolled components in React. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?","expected_answer_outline":"Explain that controlled components have their state managed by React, while uncontrolled components have their state managed by the DOM. Controlled components provide more control and predictability, while uncontrolled components can be simpler to implement in some cases. Discuss the use of `ref` in uncontrolled components."},{"id":18,"topic":"JavaScript","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"Explain the concept of the event loop in JavaScript. How does it handle asynchronous operations?","expected_answer_outline":"Explain that the event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations without blocking the main thread. It continuously checks the message queue for tasks and executes them in order. Discuss the call stack, the message queue, and the event loop's role in managing asynchronous callbacks."},{"id":19,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Advanced","question":"What are the benefits of using TypeScript with React? How does it improve code quality and maintainability?","expected_answer_outline":"Explain that TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, which helps catch errors early during development. It also improves code readability and maintainability by providing type annotations and interfaces. Discuss the benefits of using TypeScript interfaces for defining component props and state."},{"id":20,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"How would you handle form validation in React? Discuss different approaches and libraries that can be used.","expected_answer_outline":"Discuss different approaches for form validation, including client-side validation using JavaScript and server-side validation. Mention libraries like Formik and React Hook Form that simplify form handling and validation in React. Explain how to display validation errors to the user."}]
