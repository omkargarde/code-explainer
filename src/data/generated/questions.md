[{"id":1,"topic":"JavaScript","difficulty":"Beginner","question":"Explain the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var` in JavaScript. Provide a simple example for each.","expected_answer_outline":"Discuss scope (block vs. function), mutability (reassignment), and hoisting differences.  Example should clearly demonstrate how each keyword behaves differently in a block scope and function scope.  Explain that `var` is function scoped and can be hoisted, while `let` and `const` are block scoped and are not hoisted in the same way.  Explain that `const` variables cannot be reassigned, but their properties can be modified if they are objects."},{"id":2,"topic":"JavaScript","difficulty":"Beginner","question":"What is a closure in JavaScript? Give a practical example and explain how it works.","expected_answer_outline":"Define closure as a function that has access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed. Illustrate with an example like a counter function that retains its state. Explain how the inner function retains a reference to the outer function's variables even after the outer function has returned."},{"id":3,"topic":"JavaScript","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"Describe Promises in JavaScript. How do they help manage asynchronous operations? Give an example of creating and resolving a Promise.","expected_answer_outline":"Explain Promises as objects representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. Describe the `pending`, `fulfilled`, and `rejected` states. Showcase creating a Promise using `new Promise()` and resolving/rejecting it with `resolve()` and `reject()`. Explain `.then()` and `.catch()` for handling success and errors."},{"id":4,"topic":"JavaScript","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"Explain `async/await` in JavaScript. How does it simplify working with asynchronous code? Convert a Promise-based code snippet to use `async/await`.","expected_answer_outline":"Explain `async/await` as syntactic sugar on top of Promises, making asynchronous code look and behave a bit more like synchronous code.  Describe how `async` functions always return a Promise and how `await` pauses execution until the Promise resolves. Show the conversion of a Promise-based code to its `async/await` equivalent to demonstrate the simplification."},{"id":5,"topic":"JavaScript","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"How do you manipulate the DOM using JavaScript? Give an example of adding a new element to the DOM and changing its text content.","expected_answer_outline":"Explain different DOM manipulation methods like `document.createElement()`, `document.getElementById()`, `document.querySelector()`, `appendChild()`, `innerHTML`, and `textContent`. Provide a clear example of creating a new `div` element, setting its text content, and appending it to the body of the document."},{"id":6,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Beginner","question":"What are React Hooks? Name a few commonly used Hooks and explain their purpose.","expected_answer_outline":"Explain Hooks as functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. Mention `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`.  Explain `useState` for managing component state, `useEffect` for performing side effects, and `useContext` for accessing context values."},{"id":7,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Beginner","question":"Explain the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components in React. Provide an example for each.","expected_answer_outline":"Explain that controlled components have their state managed by React, while uncontrolled components have their state managed by the DOM itself. Provide examples of a controlled input using `useState` and an uncontrolled input using `ref`."},{"id":8,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"Describe the React component lifecycle methods. Which methods are deprecated and why?","expected_answer_outline":"Explain the lifecycle methods: `constructor`, `render`, `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, `componentWillUnmount`.  Mention that `componentWillMount`, `componentWillReceiveProps`, and `componentWillUpdate` are deprecated and why (potential for misuse, issues with async rendering). Explain how `getDerivedStateFromProps` and `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate` replaced some of their functionality."},{"id":9,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"Explain different state management approaches in React. When would you choose Context API versus a library like Redux or Zustand?","expected_answer_outline":"Discuss `useState`, `useReducer`, Context API, Redux, Zustand, and other options. Explain that Context API is suitable for simple state management needs within a limited scope (e.g., theme).  Explain that Redux and Zustand are better suited for complex applications with global state that needs to be accessed and updated from multiple components."},{"id":10,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"How does the Context API work in React? Give an example of how you would create a context and consume it in a component.","expected_answer_outline":"Explain how Context API allows you to share values like themes, user authentication, or preferred language between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree. Show an example using `React.createContext()`, `Provider`, and `useContext()` to create a context and consume its value within a component."},{"id":11,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Advanced","question":"What are some techniques for optimizing React application performance? Discuss memoization, code splitting, and lazy loading.","expected_answer_outline":"Discuss memoization using `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Explain code splitting using dynamic imports (`React.lazy` and `Suspense`) to reduce initial bundle size. Explain lazy loading of images or components that are not immediately visible on the screen to improve initial load time. Also, briefly mention virtualization for large lists and batching state updates."},{"id":12,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Advanced","question":"Explain the concept of Server-Side Rendering (SSR) in React. What are its benefits and drawbacks? How would you implement it?","expected_answer_outline":"Explain that SSR involves rendering React components on the server and sending the fully rendered HTML to the client. Discuss benefits like improved SEO, faster initial load time, and better user experience for slow connections. Discuss drawbacks like increased server complexity and potential for node server load. Briefly mention frameworks like Next.js and Remix that simplify SSR implementation."},{"id":13,"topic":"JavaScript","difficulty":"Advanced","question":"Explain the event loop in JavaScript. How does it handle asynchronous operations?","expected_answer_outline":"Explain the call stack, the event queue, and the interaction between them. Explain how asynchronous operations (like `setTimeout`, AJAX calls, DOM events) are handled by the event loop: they are pushed to the event queue after completion, and the event loop moves them to the call stack when the stack is empty."},{"id":14,"topic":"React","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"How do you handle forms in React, including validation? Show an example.","expected_answer_outline":"Explain that forms can be handled as controlled or uncontrolled components. Demonstrate a controlled form with `useState` for each input field, handling `onChange` events, and performing validation (e.g., checking for required fields, email format). Show how to display error messages based on validation results.  Mention libraries like Formik and React Hook Form for more complex form handling."},{"id":15,"topic":"JavaScript","difficulty":"Intermediate","question":"What are higher-order functions in JavaScript? Provide an example using array methods like `map`, `filter`, or `reduce`.","expected_answer_outline":"Define higher-order functions as functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as their results. Show an example of using `map` to transform an array of numbers, `filter` to select specific elements based on a condition, or `reduce` to calculate a sum or aggregate value."}]
